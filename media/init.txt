# Options are:
#  display_w: sets display width. Valid values are 1024 to 1920
#  display h: sets height. Valid values are 768 to 1200
#  vol_music: sets music volume. Valid values are 0 to 100 (music isn't implemented yet).
#  vol_effect: sets effects volume. Valid values are 0 to 100 
#  fullscreen: uses a fullscreen window at your current display resolution.
#              (display_w/h values are ignored). True fullscreen isn't currently 
#              supported. This mode is recommended unless you have a good reason not
#              to use it.
#  special_cursor: uses the game's own mouse cursor instead of your system's.
#                  (use this if the system's mouse cursor isn't displaying correctly,
#                  e.g. if clicks are registered in a different place)
#
#
# Example:
# display_w 1900
# display_h 1100
# vol_music 50
# vol_effect 80
# fullscreen
# special_cursor

display_w 1350
display_h 768
