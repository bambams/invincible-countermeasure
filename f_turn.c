// This file contains functions to load and save player and game turnfiles
// it uses some of the functions in f_save.c and f_load.c

/*

Here's how turnfiles will work:

First, someone creates a gamefile (.gam)
Each player receives the gamefile.
Each player loads the gamefile and sets up templates.
Each player saves a turnfile using a sysmenu button?? (actually probably a template button)
 - turnfile has free-form name, although the default extension is .tf (it's up to players to agree to naming conventions).
Players share turnfiles.
Each player can:
 - load the gamefile if turn 0, or otherwise load their saved game (which should have been saved at the end of the previous turn).
 - load in all players' turnfiles.
 - start the game, which will run identically for everyone.

This means that turnfiles just need to store:
 - the contents of each of the player's templates.
 - basic information about the game being played, to check consistency? not sure this is even needed.
I'm pretty sure that's all.
