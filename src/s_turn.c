/*

This file contains functions to deal with the pregame and inter-turn phase.

During an interturn phase, the game is soft paused
A button in the system menu allows advancement to next turn.

Pregame is exactly the same
Before pregame, the system program can run silently (no display) until it triggers some kind of event (maybe there should be a limit on number of ticks). This lets it set things up for the first round.
Perhaps it can also cause the game to run.
During this time everything runs normally, except that input methods don't work
