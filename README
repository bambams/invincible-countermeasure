Disclaimer: As far as I know, this game is the work of Linley Henzell from
allegro.cc: https://www.allegro.cc/members/id/3963.

The release-beta2-unix branch, including this README and copyright notice,
are the work of Brandon McCaig (bambams) aiming to assemble a more
UNIX-like-friendly distribution of the Beta 2 release. These were
published incrementally into the discussion thread (see below) and
eventually to a GitHub fork at
https://github.com/bambams/invincible-countermeasure/.

It is based on the following release files:

623a5d6880cf355d7a22d8d4ad855b21e86cc9ed  IC-beta2-src.zip

The project can be found on the allegro.cc Depot here:
https://www.allegro.cc/depot/InvincibleCountermeasure

Linley also appears to have created a GitHub repository at
https://github.com/linleyh/invincible_cm, though it looks like he has yet
to push any commits to it.

There is also a SourceForge project containing the release at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/invincible-countermeasure/, but again
there appear to be no [public] commits.

The release has a discussion thread on allegro.cc here:
